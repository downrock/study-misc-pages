  - **Business Logic Tier:** Application tier and app servers (Middle Tier).
  - **Presentation Tier:** Frontend, client computer, Web server (Top Tier).

### AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- **IAM Policy Components:** Sid, Effect, Principal, Action, Resource, Condition, and Version.
- Policies control fine-grained access to resources.
